# Data Science Practice & Skills Development

Progressive practice projects and exercises for deepening technical fluency across core data science domains.

## Structure

**Projects** - Self-paced implementations exploring specific analytical challenges:
- **Projects 1-2**: A/B testing with cohort effects - exploring temporal confounding and cohort-based segmentation in experimental design
- **Project 3**: Advanced financial forecasting - multi-seasonality modeling and regime shift detection in time series

**Muscle Memory Practice** - Structured exercises focused on Python fluency, speed, and code quality. Daily practice sessions targeting pandas operations, data manipulation patterns, and analytical workflows to build unconscious competence with core libraries.

## Purpose

This repository supports ongoing technical development - maintaining and expanding proficiency in statistical modeling, experimental design, and Python implementation as part of continuous professional practice.
